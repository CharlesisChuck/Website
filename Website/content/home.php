  <p>In the future however, this will be a hub for your own eductional journey and scheduling. The plan is to have individuals sign in and they can keep track of all classes through the site as well as their daily scheduling with the website and through future phone apps</p>
  <p>If find that it is hard to find the courses, books and information of your previous classes. I want this to make it easier for individuals to think of a problem and instantly be able to find the content they need.</p>

  <h3 class="inner-heading">Personal Philosophy</h3>
  <p>Sacrifice and deep curiosity is the way to success. Find everything around you interesting and learn about as much as you can. Give up the pleasures of today for the rewards of tomorrow. Never believe that you can learn everything through expirience, far smarter individuals have come before you. Many of whom have written down their expiriences. Stand on the shoulders of giants if you wish to be one.</p>
   
  <blockquote><p>Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless â€” like water. Now you put water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.- Bruce Lee<p></blockquote>
