	<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
	<p>I'm an electrical engineer from Florida who has since dropped and sold everything to move to sillicon valley for a chance to do something big.</p>
	<p>Born in Virginia, college in Florida, I decided to make my stay at sillicon valley because the culture of the area is incredible. It still amazes me when my Uber driver is also a CEO, and I think it always will.</p>

	<h3>Why do I take all these classes?</h3>
	<p>I've been learning multiple random subjects since I started reading Feynman's work in college. His curiousity is highly contagious and I've since been trying to learn a bit of everything.</p>

	<p>In the past I've mostly been focusing on physics and electronics. However, for the past year I've dove head first into much larger variety of topics: <li>Fluid Mechanics</li><li>Heat Transfer</li><li>Materials</li><li>Hands on (cars, welding, constuction)</li><li>Buissness</li><li>Investment</li><li>People</li> <p></p> Most recently I've been going head first into the massive area of computer sciences. Here are the topics I'm learning now.<p></p> <li>Linux ubuntu</li><li>Python 3</li><li>PHP</li><li>Javascript</li><li>Java 8</li><li>Website Design</li><li>Operating systems</li><li>Networking</li></p>

	<p><h4>My Current CS Goals:</h4> <li>Learn and Build a website(tada!)</li><li>Learn Multiple languages (check out my <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/curt_charles_ee" class="#"><strong> hackerrank</strong></a> page)</li><li>Programming Job!</li></p>
